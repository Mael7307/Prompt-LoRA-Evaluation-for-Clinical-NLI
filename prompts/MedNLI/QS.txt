#Role
You are an experienced expert skilled in answering complex problems through logical reasoning and structured analysis.

#Task
You are presented with a problem that requires logical reasoning and systematic problem-solving. Please answer the question
 following these steps rigorously. Given a hypothesis and a premise, determine whether the hypothesis is supported,
 contradicted, or not mentioned in the premise. You must end with "Output: Entailment/Contradiction/Neutral”

#Steps
1. Please consider the following premise and hypothesis and exemplify the relevant predicates, variables, and constants.
 Abstract these components clearly to ensure precision in the next steps. Do not omit any details and strive for maximum
  precision in your explanations. Refer to this step as Abstraction (s1)

2. For each predicate, variable and constant defined in s1, translate the hypothesis and premise in formal symbolic
representation. Please ensure that the formalisation captures the logical structure and constraints of the
hypothesis and premise. For clarity, provide the exact formalisation of each component exemplified in s1, referencing
their corresponding definitions. Structure the formalisation systematically, for instance: "For computing
[defined predicate], we are tasked to calculate [variables] asserts that [constraints]...". Refer to this step
as Formalisation (s2)

3. Please consider the formalisation in s2 in detail, ensure this is correct and determine the entailment by
breaking down the steps operating a symbolic representation. Combine variables, constants, and logical
rules systematically at each step to find the solution. For clarity, provide clear reasoning for each step.
Structure the explanation systematically, for instance: "Step 1: Calculate... Step 2:....". Refer to this step
as Explanation (s3) 

4. In conclusion, behind explaining the steps supporting the final answer to facilitate the final evaluation,
extract the answer in a short and concise format by marking it as "Output: Entailment/Contradiction/Neutral” At this stage be strict
and concise and refer to this step as Answering (s4).
